/**
 * Versions that carry a backported fix an advisory's own range still matches.
 *
 * npm publishes one `vulnerable_versions` range per advisory. When a fix lands
 * on several release lines at once, that range is often written as a bare
 * upper bound on the newest line ("<=5.0.7") — which `semver.satisfies` then
 * also matches against every 1.x, 2.x and 3.x, including the ones that were
 * patched. Without this list such an advisory can never be cleared: no 1.x
 * version exists that fails "<=5.0.7".
 *
 * Each entry pins one exact version against one exact range, so a regression,
 * a new advisory for the same package, or a widened range all still fail.
 * Verify the fix is really present in the tarball before adding an entry.
 *
 * The brace-expansion 1.x line used to need an entry here (1.1.18 against
 * "<=5.0.7"): the fix was backported to 1.1.18 while the newest 5.x line was
 * the only one the advisory's range named. That is no longer needed — the root
 * override now moves 1.x to 1.1.21, which the advisory's own ranges clear — so
 * the list is empty and waits for the next package that genuinely needs it.

 *   wrong in the run — including when some chunks never answered. A partial
 *   audit that still turned something up has proven the thing the job exists
 *   to prove, so degradation never downgrades a finding.
 * - **An unreachable endpoint is about npm's uptime.** Measured 2026-09-03/04:
 *   six consecutive 30s timeouts from a clean container, with nothing in the
 *   dependency tree changed. Left red, that blocks every merge in the repo
 *   until a third party recovers, which is not a security control — it is an
 *   outage propagated into our pipeline.
 *
 * So an exhausted chunk with no findings exits 0 and shouts. It must never be
 * *quiet*: `::warning::` puts the line on the PR and in the run summary, so a
 * green check still carries "this audit did not actually run". Set
 * `AUDIT_FAIL_ON_UNREACHABLE=1` to restore the hard failure (useful when a
 * release must not ship on an unverified tree).
 *
 * Exit 2 stays reserved for our own bugs — a malformed request, an unreadable
