# PreToolUse guard for the mechanical mistakes that have actually bitten this
# repo — one script for both agents: Claude Code runs it from
# .claude/settings.json, OpenHands from .openhands/hooks.json.
#
#   1. A wholesale rewrite of prisma/schema.prisma (~10k lines; it has been
#      truncated by a rewrite before). It must only ever be edited surgically:
#      a file `Write`/`create`, or a terminal redirect, `tee`, `dd of=`, `cp` or
#      `mv` onto it, is refused.
#   2. A `git push` that would land on `main` — named (`origin main`,
#      `HEAD:main`, `+main`), implicit (no destination while on main or
#      tracking it), or every branch at once (`--all`, `--mirror`); also
#      behind a wrapper (`sudo`, `env`, `timeout`, …), in a subshell, in
#      `sh -c`/`eval`, or in `$( )`. Under `xargs`, or with a `$VAR`
#      destination, it cannot see where the push lands and refuses. Work
#      happens on feature branches; an agent never pushes main. The `main`
#      ruleset (no bypass) is the wall; this is the warning in front of it.
#   3. Sensitive text written into a Markdown file of this repository (project
#      memory, docs, guides). The repo is public until release; the rule is in
#      AGENTS.md → "Where things live", the patterns in
#      .github/scripts/check-sensitive.py (the Security CI job runs the same
#      script). The machine-local memories (~/.claude/projects/…/memory/,
#      ~/.openhands/memory/) are not checkouts, so they are never checked —
#      that is where sensitive notes belong.
#   4. A write to .openhands/memory/MEMORY.md. With "Persistent Agent Memory"
#      on, OpenHands is told to fold what it learned into that file; here it is
#      a committed pointer, and the project memory lives in .claude/memory/
#      (decided 2026-10-09). The refusal says where the finding goes instead.
#
# The two tools name things differently: Claude's `Bash` / `Write` / `Edit` /
# `MultiEdit` with `file_path` / `content` / `new_string`, OpenHands'
# `terminal` / `file_editor` with `path` / `command` / `file_text` / `new_str`,
# and the working directory arrives as `cwd` or `working_dir`. Both are read.
#
# The hook reads the tool call as JSON on stdin. Exit 0 allows the call; exit 2
# blocks it and shows the message to the model. Anything the guard does not
# recognise is allowed — it fails open on purpose, so a parsing hiccup can never
# wedge a session. apps/api/src/utils/agent-guard.guard.test.ts holds the cases.
