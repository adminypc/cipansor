# Flag pull requests the review gate left unreviewed. Run hourly by
# gate-watch.yml (#776).
#
# pr-lifecycle.sh dispatches `Gerbang tinjau PR` (OpenHands Cloud) once a ready
# PR is green, and a 2xx answer only says the request was accepted, not that a
# review will come. From 2026-10-10 five PRs sat green for a day with no review
# and nothing said so. A step that stays silent has failed too; this makes the
# silence visible and says where to look.
#
# A PR is "waiting on the gate" when:
#   * it is open and not a draft,
#   * every check in REQUIRED_CHECKS is present on its head, the latest run of
#     each is completed and none is red, and a check from every known suite has
#     published (a green subset — CI done before E2E — is still pending),
#   * the last of them completed more than WAIT_MINUTES ago,
#   * and GATE_LOGIN has left no review on that head commit.
# It does not rely on the dispatch itself, which is recorded only in a workflow
# log: a green, ready head with no gate review is the symptom, whatever the
# cause.
#
# The gate definition (REQUIRED_CHECKS, KNOWN_SUITE_SIGNS, the latest-run-per-
# name rule, and red/pending restricted to the gate checks) is the same as
# pr-lifecycle.sh: an advisory check that fails, a re-run still in flight, or a
# green subset must not be read as the gate's silence.
#
# For those PRs:
#   * one re-dispatch of the gate per head commit, when OPENHANDS_API_KEY is
#     set: a run lost to the platform (a sandbox that never came up, a 429) is
#     retried once, as docs/SDLC-FLOW.md planned; a second silence is a human's;
#   * one comment per head commit (marker `gate-watch:<sha>`), never repeated,
#     saying whether the re-dispatch was accepted;
#   * one health issue (marker `gate-watch:health`, label `automation-health`)
#     listing them, updated in place only when the list changes, and closed
#     with a comment once the list is empty. One issue for the cause, not one
#     per PR.
#
# Usage: gate-watch.sh
# Env:   GH_TOKEN, REPO (owner/name), WAIT_MINUTES (default 60),
#        GATE_LOGIN (default cipansor-bot), NOW (epoch seconds; for tests),
#        OPENHANDS_API_KEY and SDLC_REVIEW_GATE_ID (optional: the re-dispatch)
