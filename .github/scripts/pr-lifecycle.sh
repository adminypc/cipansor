# Post the CI result and dispatch the review gate once a PR is fully green.
#
#   green checks on a draft PR    -> post the all-green comment (informational)
#   green checks on a ready PR    -> dispatch the review gate (`Gerbang tinjau PR`)
#   red checks                      -> do nothing
#   changes requested on the head   -> do nothing (waiting for fixes)
#   changes requested on an older commit, green head -> dispatch the gate again
#
# This script never approves, never merges and never changes the draft/ready
# state. A maintainer decides when a PR is ready; the review gate (`Gerbang tinjau PR`)
# decides the verdict. A red or changes-requested PR is deliberately left open:
# the gate posts the request-changes review itself, and branch protection blocks
# the merge until it is resolved. Reverting a PR to draft was tried and dropped —
# it does not help a human and hides work that is still being iterated on.

# A job skipped by its own `if:` (a docs-only PR reports `scope.run=false`, so

# `skipped` conclusion is excluded from RED (which lists only real failures) and
# from PENDING (which lists conclusions this gate does not call green). A docs
# PR is therefore green once every check is *present* and none failed, which is
# what lets it reach the gate. Presence is still required, so a green subset (an
# early CI finish before E2E has published its checks) stays pending.

# checked-in workflows publish checks: `CI scope` (ci.yml) and `E2E scope`
