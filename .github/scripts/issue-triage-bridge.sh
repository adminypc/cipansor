# Dispatch the issue triage owner when another automation has responded, or when
# an open, not-`ready` issue has new activity.
#
# Why this exists: nothing in the fleet fires on `issues.edited`, so a reporter
# who edits an issue description gets no re-triage (found on #818, whose body was
# edited twice after triage with no answer). The triage owner is instead
# dispatched deterministically by this bridge:
#
#   --stdin   a bot applies a type or priority label — the labeler responded, so
#             the triage owner studies the issue and the bot's comment
#   --sweep   an open, not-`ready` issue has new activity by someone other than
#             the fleet — this catches an edited description or a new comment
#             without a trigger on `issues.edited`
#
# The sweep keys on an *activity signal*: a hash of the issue body plus every
# non-fleet comment's author, body and `updated_at`. A description edit, a new
# comment or an edited comment changes the hash, and it is compared with the
# checkpoint stored in the sweep marker. Because the signal is content, not a
# second-resolution timestamp, a reporter edit made in the same second as the
# marker write is still a different signal and is caught (the old
# `updated_at <= comment_time` comparison swallowed it). The fleet's own comments
# (the bot and GitHub Actions) are excluded, so a bot reply never re-triages the
# issue — that is what keeps the loop closed.
#
# The checkpoint is written only after the dispatch is accepted (HTTP 2xx): a
# failed dispatch leaves the old checkpoint, so the next sweep retries it and the
# run fails loudly instead of looking like a quiet, completed sweep.
#
# An issue whose summary lives in the body with no marker comment (triaged before
# this bridge existed) has no checkpoint, so it is dispatched once as a migration
# and given a marker; the body marker is never a reason to skip it.
#
# The triage owner is idempotent (one comment per round, updated in place), so a
# duplicate dispatch is not a duplicate comment — the markers exist to save runs.
