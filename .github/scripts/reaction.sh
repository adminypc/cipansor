# React to an issue, a pull request, or a comment so the person can see an
# automation has picked it up. A reporter who opens an issue, or a maintainer
# who comments `@openhands …`, otherwise has no signal that anything is
# happening until a bot comment appears minutes later — the reporter asked for
# this (2026-10-13). The `eyes` reaction means "the automation is looking at
# this"; the automated comment that follows carries the substance.
#
# Idempotent: the reaction is added once and never stacked. Before adding, the
# bot's own reactions on that object are removed, so a run that fires twice (a
# webhook re-delivery, a retry) leaves exactly one.
#
# Usage: reaction.sh <number> [comment-id]
#        <number>       the issue or pull request number
#        [comment-id]   react to that comment instead of the issue/PR itself
# Env:   GH_TOKEN (the bot's token, so the reaction reads as cipansor-bot),
#        REPO (owner/name), REACTION (default eyes)
