# Cipansor IMS — OpenHands repository setup.
#
# OpenHands runs this file at the start of every conversation on this repo
# (docs.openhands.dev → Usage → Customization → Repository → "Setup Script"),
# so a fresh sandbox is ready to build, test and e2e without manual installs.
# It is idempotent: re-running on a warm sandbox is cheap.
#
# It deliberately does NOT seed the database or start the stack. Seeding
# TRUNCATEs every table (root AGENTS.md; apps/api/prisma/AGENTS.md), and
# bringing the stack up is the `stack` skill's job — do that when you need the
# app or a browser sweep running.
